EVERY CONNECTED GRAPH CONTAINS A SPANNING TREE

The GRAPH POEM, as a FINITE CONNECTED graph growing to INFINITY, is SPANNABLE by TREES that grow INFINITE

EXPANSION of the GRAPH POEM: a given VERTEX (a poem) is connected to a new one, which is a found poem that shares predefined features with the former; a THIRD VERTEX (poem) is then produced as a variation of / solo for the previous two ones

end in an infinite graph—equivalence class of rays which for any finite S all have a tail in a component of G-S

TREE ENDS—two rays are equivalent in a tree if and only if they share a tail

STUDYING the ENDS of the GRAPH POEM is studying the ENDS of the TREE that spans it; 

Since ANY VERTEX may be chosen to be the ROOT of the spanning tree,

Picking a certain poem (vertex) to be the ROOT shall reveal the 

PROPHETIC side 

of the GRAPH POEM: 

the TREE ENDS show us the evolution of poetry into infinity should we consider a certain poem the root of the TREE of POETRY composed by a virtually infinite community of poets, both human and/or electronic
