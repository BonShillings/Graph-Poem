When she wrote a song critical of one of the chiefs, she was banished to a west coast island. While she was exiled there, she composed another song.


I am a cow    such a beautiful plaited

tail    A marvel comes out     two stresses
a rhyme    several verses

in the rear-end gait
(Moo)       of a cow (they say)
 
But how do I know   I must take
a bone flute and       blow through the holes

to make    music

Each time that I lick
and don’t bite     the bull face

the bull mind
I hear what    they think

Those heavy bulls   with their balls
do not know

They fuck     whatever lies down
or backs up 

So I walk ahead    on my own and compose 

I am still a cow       in their minds 
but in mine    there’s a poem 

God’s breath    in the grass
God’s hand    in the wind

and I’m not     just
not just    blinded with shit
