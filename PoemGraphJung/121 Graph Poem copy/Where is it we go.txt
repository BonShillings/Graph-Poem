Thought 
it’s 
always 
been quiet 
along the distance. 
Or have I been the one mad man? 
I mustn’t dare to know, or hope to seek another, 
lest I tumble to the midnight pool to which scattered ones amble willingly. 
The gaping hole above holds no judgement over fallen truths. It’s the step that leads that should be met with cautionary tells. Where is it we go?
