It takes me; sedates me; forsakes me,  
and i never meant the real thing 
I just mean the songs they used to sing 
their sounds travel on  
but what really surround me? 
This little boy approached me, 
and berates me with 
everything. 
Seemingly, I've mumbled sleepily. 
Reality faces me, disregards me. 
This is me, or was he me? I am me, so who is he? 
An ex-self; now my excuse. 
As I keep seducing an image, 
the mirror he shows me reveals the idle cruising I've concealed. 
This little boy wants an embrace of this cigarette. 
He excuses me to forget 
that I'm so far ahead of myself. 
  
Far behind are the signs 
that my mind isn't kind 
the world's rhymes sink in time 
and I can't find my dozen dimes. 
This cigarette burns, my insides turn 
its concerns aren't to learn 
but to forget my regrets 
I figure its forgotten bet 
It's not fear or the clear spirit 
It's the mirror that disappears 
Kill instead the bitter head 
or better yet the words he said 
Gather round as its echoes sound 
For the sound that plays 
too damn loud... 
The voice is void 
A boy needs his word not to be heard 
but to cure what his heart burns 
He's so hurt, and he's so sure 
that there's no such thing as dessert.
