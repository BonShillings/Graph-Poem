Finding poems to branch out through involves word-units as well as line-units; when a poem is identified as a possible new vertex [which means that it contains a (sequence of) word(s) in common with the one it ramifies, or as well semantically related to them), it is evaluated according to the ways in which the role played by those connecting elements in the economy of the poem as a whole and in the latter’s interplay with the vertex it ramifies.  In that respect, the function of that connecting part is expected to be not simply isomorphic or coincidential with no further impact on the graph poem as an expanding sequence, but rather enlarging, enriching, translational, relevantly interactive, contrapuntal (comic) or contrastive, in short building unexpected, relevant, possibly complex, and in any case entirely relational meaning.  Ramifying Tthe line “and mine own talk closed inside” in Houlihan’s “Put with the Odd” by “both th prosecutor at th last sentencing nd/ Louis Dudek at the Poets Conference in T.O./ sd if he’s any good as a poet he’l write just/ as well inside jail as on th street:” in bill bissett’s “[either way as if what yu decide]” for instance sheds an unexpected light on both poems, as what may be the ‘true’ voice and tongue of the oppressed in the former is thus equated with a fakely representative mouthpiece in the latter.  The way in which bissett’s speaker refuses to be manipulated into political discourse by either the state or his own ‘official’ fellow-poet—and relevantly enough, thus avoiding the politics of literature as well, as he wouldn’t be forced into the “good poem” writing author (who compliantly ‘delivers’ to/entertains/accommodates the reader) cliché-category either—corresponds on a certain level with Houlihan’s character’s determination to keep his own speech “closed” (and thus impervious to commodification, manipulation, and enslavement).  Besides, the extension of the graph locally follows certain force lines in shaping specific configurations, such as in following oppressed/exterminated/‘underdog’ minority voices and themes in expanding from Ipellie’s “Dancing Sun” to Houlihan’s “Put with the Odd” to bill bissett’s “[either way, as if what yu decide]” and on to the further S-E Asian ramifications, just as the U Sam Oeur—bill bissett—Ipellie—Coman—MARGENTO sequence articulates a death/birth, alienation/exile, damnation/derision, and carnival/apocalypse complex.
