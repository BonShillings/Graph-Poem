author: Mehrdad_Arefani title: Execution

Be it a misty morning
or drizzling on the night flower
Be it sunny 
or foggy         with scattered showers
Having now arrived at the tree
The tree now
or no tree
but a wooden pole
No
a stone wall
No

Perhaps a tree
Perhaps with the sea behind 
There is a chance before they come:
day job
falling in love
opening the door
the scent of bread or
watching snow through the window

The good taste of apples becomes a wall
Grandma’s prayer mat becomes a dam
The scent of pomegranates becomes a roadblock
to this hurried screech of lead rushing forward

					translated from the Persian by Abol Froushan]
