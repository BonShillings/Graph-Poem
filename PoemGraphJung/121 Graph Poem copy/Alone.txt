I’ll retrace our vague footsteps we had taken on the east pacific
So specific I must be, for surely I’ll take my troubles to my sleep.
But sleep I can’t for the shadows of the nights collectively confide
To me the side of the tide that was dark inside all along
Out where our love drowned down beneath the waves
Or, were we slaves to each other’s shame?

All I know now is that I’ve been alone.
I’ve always been alone
I’ve been alone, all this time

If only we’d been shown that lovers’ ends are such a tragic trend
Then maybe there’d be a part of us that could still contend
But now I’m rusted, it must’ve been all the pain I had contained
Oh I’ve lusted for the moments we had our sustenance, it’s hard
I’ve swallowed down my guilt, down with this bottle that I tilt
Lit the light, until gone was my sight. 

All I know now is that I’ve been alone
I’ve always been alone
I’ve been alone, all this time

Am I to kill the lovers’ dreams, as it seems
To tear our hearts right down the seams
I stare into the devil’s eyes; maybe this is why we cry
Such a sight could always cause our souls to sigh

I still hear our friends laugh with us, call to us
But we shan’t make a fuss, remember we lost them to lust
Though, I’m not sure who we are anymore, I don’t even know where I go
Slowly we go to transition to the backdrop with the ghosts

It’s maddening the thing we could have been
The angels would have sung, but they’re now distant
Instead they sing their sad song on the shores that we longed
What was there beneath the happy couple that we seemed?

We couldn’t survive the ride back down to the tide
Just hopeful lovers trying to remain on the side
So Samantha, now your spirit is drowned, with this bottle that I down

Knowing that I’ve been alone
I’ve always been alone
I’ve been alone all this time

And hopefully they see to it that our memories don’t fade
Though they were never good at shielding the shade
Perhaps the wind will pick my fears back down with the waves
But I’ve been to afraid to lay down what needs to be laid
