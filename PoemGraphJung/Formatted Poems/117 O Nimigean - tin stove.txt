who knows how old you are, tin stove?
is it true you were wrought by a couple of gypsies?
one with a moustache the other still a kid with a smooth face
yet already married to a slender miss piranda with gentle hands and big eyes
who turned the heads of rumanian peasants down the country lane and whom 
lump in throat I myself would watch sashay in her flouncy layered skirt?

but the gypsies never really shaped you, they just drove some rivets in,
fixed your oven and tinkered for you a zinc-plated
silver-looking ashtray

here you come on your long anubis legs covered in lacquer—
but you don’t actually come, you linger one place, just being once in a while moved
from old home to new home from summer kitchen into kitchen
you don’t come we’re the ones coming and going, shortly 
extending our hands over your iron cast cooktop, 
and then disappearing in the memory 
of those presently holding that you do come

(in my confused last mohican’s memory 
stumbling upon you after lustra in the very same place
as if I hadn’t been away not even for one week
your stovepipe a bit twisted your oven door 
fallen on the stool where the dish washing bowl
has remained unremoved for ages
your little lid missing and letting out
tiny flame crests, you flashy chick!)

look it’s been almost two years in which morning after morning
(with just some short mysterious respites 
I won’t tell you about
since you wouldn’t get a thing of what
I hardly stammer myself letter-by-letter)
I kept gagging you with crammed paper dipped in diesel
(after casting a glance
on writers’ portraits
on poems and titles)
cooking soups and stews with you
boiling hot water for a bath in large pots
their bottoms larger than your top
dismantling you every other month
using a besom 
and a knife to wipe out
the thick soot lichens
baking on you sliced potatoes,
bell peppers aubergines
polishing you for easter and christmas
cursing you on your bad days
more and more often
as you filled the kitchen with smoke
as you let that poisoning smoke out of all your avernine orifices 
which I vainly mended with yellow clay

now unaccounted the aeon shifts
or maybe it doesn’t it’s just
the mix of resignation and hope
of an age gone down the drain
blamed on the firmament’s rotation
—still kind of too much of a sudden change
the last soup’s cinders still smoldering
as it dawned on me you no longer
belong here
you no longer belong anywhere

I dragged you on the hard floors
pulled you across the threshold
your legs gone weak
fouldering like a convict
who approaches the scaffold
out in the backyard
by the junk shed
meister paul
quickly pulled your cooktop off 
exposing
your brick reddish innards
the first autumn rain
drenched your hearth all night long
I drove my finger at dawn
through a thick layer of mud

stove-of-tin
stove-of-tin
you’re now a clunker bin
tinker’s-tinny-stove
tinker’s-tinny-stove
gonna rust in the rain
gonna rust in the snow
stove-of-iron-cast
stove-of-iron-cast
gonna lie among the ghosts
thrown out in the backyard lost
eaten up by worms of rust
poltergeists will hang around
with you lying in the dump
dirty muddy swamped
broken-stove
broken-stove
in your hearth there’ll be a growth
of green flames that never need
any poking any feed
and your tin will have its way
rotting in decay

farewell now farewell
the rest is an inaudible purring 
a soft crackling of invisible flames
when we truly have a heart we shall sense it
the kettle shall levitate over your flaky body
the berry tea shall boil over
spreading the hiprose the blackberry the blackthorn
	the raspberry and the basil aromas all around
