The FallIsaac Watters            When the leaves are browningand the pumpkins are sellingthe shadowy owl swoops and hoots          meeting the oldest man in the world	  to tell him Winter is not coming.	Yes the leaves will falloff brown branching spinesand slight breezes will turn mean      blowing your hat	into wet puddles.	Do not worry old man,if we have one Autumnthat is better than many Winters.     Remember your Winters	   they were cold.	But there is no more snowand another season of learningto regurgitate, leaves     will stifle Autumn.	   Faking his burden,	old man watch your maplesdying for good,tap the brown branches    off-season and stick out your tongue licking	   sick syrup.	Trust the fall old mancatch your hatand here take this wool sweater     it is brisk	   and you look cold.	The fallen leaves are bonding,a great brown hand of Autumn melancholy			choking your trees.
