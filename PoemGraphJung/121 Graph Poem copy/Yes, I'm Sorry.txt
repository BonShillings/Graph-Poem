Yes, I’m confused all over again
It’s complicated, yet so elating
False perception represents a friend.
Simplicated being; it’s debating.
Shadows of a shadow won’t show themselves.
So shallow is the sight my mind becomes.
Contrary wars will wage in my parallels.
Deeply longing to linger; will succumbs.
How am I to watch the sun rise above
if I, obligated, just walk alone?
Clouds follow me, hindering just enough
Piercing cackle, I’m shackled, I just know
Freedom seldom presents itself freely,
I’ll continue paddling, traveling, I’m sorry.
