Lonely girl has cockroaches up her spine;
tosses and turns to the sound of her voice.
She's held ill to the prison of a mind, 
always haunted by poetry of noise. 
Coloured fever of thought continues on, 
despite the home of a ghostly display. 
Iced champagne is fine, if she's gone for long; 
desires creep as they're taken away.
Sacred is her vicious cycle of crap.
She can't help herself; satisfaction's not free. 
And delicious is the drink of relapse. 
Her head throbs the feel of finality. 
There's reason her surface screams lonely girl. 
It makes sense; she's alone in her dirt world.
