The theatre of memories entices hopeless feats
Let this day-dreamer’s window of ‘what-if’ images
Substitute breaths of this moment’s seat 
He fools some life against his time’s ‘it isn’t.’
Contradiction sings the theme of his practice
fancy if it were, in end, it simply is not and can’t be
But see, ‘it was’ and the expansion’s attractive
The ancient reels of affection still kick into scene
Descriptions prove inadequate remembrance.
They gather up as much meaning as Wednesday.
Frustrated movement kicks blues into such distance
The ways of his model for God will always be up for debate
beads of sweet frustration break his mosaic,
Pressure’ll pop useless sighs and then it’ll be too late.
