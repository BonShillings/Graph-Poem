title: The Dancing Sun

There were times in the Inuit land
When the sun danced for us.
All the Inuit stopped their daily routines at work
And sat to watch the sun dance in the Inuit way.

The Inuit would sit and admire the smiling sun.
The animals, too, it’s been known, would do the same.
“I am a happy sun,” he would say. “Come dance with me.”
All the Inuit would join hands and dance, and dance, and dance…

The dance would enlighten the minds of the people
And prepare them to face the day in joy.
It was great to have a sun who danced for you,
Make you laugh and have a wonderful time.

Sometimes the clouds would come and cover the sky
So we couldn’t see the dancing sun for several days.
But as soon as the clouds were gone with the wind,
The sun would appear again and say,

“Come dance with me!”
All the Inuit would come and dance in joy
With the dancing sun who danced in the Inuit way
In the Inuit land.
