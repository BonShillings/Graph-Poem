We're too baked to drive to the devil's house. 
'That says a lot.' 

A passive itch spiders down, 
that we've once heard the same. 

He glares at us... 
Subtlety takes us. 

And so goes the ocean 
He sets fire to get her going again 

Hold. 

My boat, amidst torched direction, 
allows uncertainty to persuade me; 
I let go. 
Chaos.

Screams surround me. 
The current berates me. 
So easily, we’re led down; 
fooled with directionless ground.

That's okay. 
I close my eyes, 
escape, 
and grasp back on. 
A lapse waves. 

Then I remember, 
We’re too baked to drive to the devil's house.
