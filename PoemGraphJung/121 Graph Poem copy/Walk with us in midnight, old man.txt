Walk with us in midnight, old man. 
Don't worry, it's us. It's time. 
We'll carry you back to mother. 

Distance does lie beyond the mist 
This is silence's last standing 
Walk with us in midnight, old man. 

Your presence is missed among us. 
Comfortably reaching beginnings, 
We'll carry you back to mother 

You leave noone, they'll meet us there 
when awoken back, but for now 
walk with us in midnight, old man. 

It'll come together, trust us.  
Give us your hand, we're going home. 
We'll carry you back to mother. 

Catch a last sigh and take it in. 
Capture the experience, and 
walk with us in midnight, old man. 
We'll carry you back to mother.
