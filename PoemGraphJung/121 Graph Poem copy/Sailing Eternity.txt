Born ablaze with broken fools,  
she sails a smile that almost would. 
Trust her picture to blush the stars 
and you will dazzle presentless hearts 
Remember boy, the sacred girl 
makes this 'two' for always, 
when this was "Who is here?" 
Vast nevers breeze away as we linger 
surrounding and flowering 
Let it all go 
Magic breathes young eternity.
