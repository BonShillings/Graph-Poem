I want to be friends with the jellyfish men 
Out in the sea where no one could see me 
Friends with friends out in the ocean with them 
Wed play all day, and all night, this is key 
We’d swim along the fishes, nothing missed, 
Simply making more friends as time was spent 
I’d forget it all, ignorance is bliss 
Out in the sea, with the jellyfish men 
And their colours would entrance to the core 
Dance and dance, Ill want to dance with friends 
And surely being friends, they’ll give me more 
Down in the deep, with the jellyfish men 
Though, down beneath the deep, it’s easy to see 
Why I could never make the friends I’m meant 
For you see it’s quite simple, I can’t breath 
Down under the sea with jellyfish men
