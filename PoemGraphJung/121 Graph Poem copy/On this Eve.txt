On this eve, A million little white lies dress my mind to paint a picture of me in my life. 
They scream that mine is not a dream.
 Always, always, and always…
I so often believe that their sliding colours cover the lines of now so profusely 
to the point that I admit defeat to tomorrow. 
Thinking means only a small something, 
and being means almost everything.
I wouldn’t be anything without the words everyone else brings., 
even with the silence that’s brought on in between.
 Thought after thought after thought after thought
 is what makes the building blocks of the world as I know it. 
Their collection of emotion that backs it all forms the final necessity of the structure we need
how I breathe it in.
My Life is the story I tell myself from moment to moment and it’s always beginning,
let’s hope that I own the right scope of it,
because each of these moments struggles to be at the star that shoots across the pool of my mind. 
Sight speaks a thousand words, 
without a single one mouthing anything worth a second thought.
 Space itself speaks only to fill our sense of curiosity. 
It’s only the question mark that forms the formless reality. 
Our nights and days meet each other at a horizon that contradicts itself. 
Confusion produced is something Im used to and I know it to be beyond assumptions.
And that’s just it.
It’s in the dawn of what brings insanity that brings along that which is truly me.
