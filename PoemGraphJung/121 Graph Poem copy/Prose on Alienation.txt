In some ways, I am grateful for my early departure from the culture. 
This alienation it causes. 

Isolated, abandoned, I avoided it.
Strange, I know.

For my solitude did not separate Self.
I came to know myself, to trust myself.
Now, thrust back into the culture, I see the true alienation;
Alienation from mind, from body, from spirit.
Lesions.

This, I now grapple with. 
Once I was singular.
Once I only saw disentanglement,

But now, 
It picks the mind apart.
This culture, this ruin of men,
The women.
End this, I am
Reeling. What am I to do?
