A vacation on top of a stove.
Smoke preserves the shoots.
Warmth maintains the timbres.

The seed I store inside the tropical forest’s vagina.
A woman born from a fever and two eyes not gouged out by the color yellow.
They are reminiscences soundly asleep inside a legendary skirt. 

Every situation in the story has cats, rabbits and some fruits.
Besides the sounds of cats and dogs, there are also cormorants, guavas, mangoes, and a bottle of fish sauce.  

One among them said if stuck on a desert island he would only need: Mozart and fish sauce.

I am a bear who does not know how to dance on stilts and juggle seven swords, only lucky to survive the uprooted forest.
I was born from a tree’s hollow and my umbilical cord was cut with a potsherd and my music is that of a woodpecker.
My smell is that of the saliva of bees mating with the honey of flowers.
My road is to climb to the trifurcated crotch of a tree to be full and drunk and to ponder for a moment then letting go and falling down.

After each fall my flesh becomes elastic and expands.
After each fall my plants grow boundlessly.
After each fall my animals multiply.
I’m tattered, I’m porous, I’m smooth, I’m bitter. And I’m...

Although I’m only an uninsured seed and without wings.

In a dense instance of idle bullets, I take off and land.

In the legend I’m the survivor who has seen the head at the bottom of a jar of fermented paste.
