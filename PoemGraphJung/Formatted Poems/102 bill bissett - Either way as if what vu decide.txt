title: [Either_way,_as_if_what_vu_decivde]

either way, as if what yu decide
to feel determines th turns
taken of such blinding flow

who dusint lie as especially
(liberal) indignation becums

an impossibility, when
as life/death is also absurdity,
yu sit behind bars, turning to
endless vapors, huh

heres that crook again back
home, just wait’l i get to
scoop him twice

it’s all one school, and if (learn, nut)
yu are aggressive so are the screws
so, cool it, we’re all part of this

historical mistake, even love
may now be possible, tho, don’t
hold yr breath, be seein’ ya,

mother earth,

both th prosecutor at th last sentencing nd
Louis Dudek at th Poets Conference in T.O.
sd if he’s any good as a poet he’l write just
as well inside jail as on th street:
I think this is a lousy pome,
what do yu think, shit-head reader,

where do you think yu are, heaven (already)
