MARGENTO sampling and improvisation
Thrown wide of sky, what goes on with no end

All the Inuit stopped their daily 
routines at work and turned into car
toons—Mosaika—projected on the Parliament

House tonight, no qaggiq for them 
or us paranoid immigrants either
so, cool it, we’re all part of this

historical mistake, even love
may now be possible, tho, don’t
hold yr breath, be seein’ ya,

mother earth,
hello acidic rain falling 
just as apocalypse day shall fall on women`s

day the world freshly razed off 
the face of the earth blowing on the wound
as if after the last waxing…
