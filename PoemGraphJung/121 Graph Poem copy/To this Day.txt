To this day, each night dawns with a passive mourn, 
shackled to the whites, and chained. 
Crowding clouds gathered pulling no shame, 
just to up and dissipate on day's end. 

They praised in attention 
to a tenative one occasion, 
or so its been pondered, 
but they all rained in wonder. 
Rise and shine. 

Sun. She needs not tell her story. 
Weathered mention sings it for her. 
It no longer mattered when led to day's end, 
then to bathe in the eyes of the sea. 
Raised to the pedestal, 
then descent to darkened fall. 

With days gone 
noone ponders still 
on their sickened wonder. 
This tenative one occasion 
was day one of eternal slumber. 
Rise and shine. 

With the attentive fascination 
of this tentative one oaccasion 
they gazed towards her, 
to the extinguishing of days. 

Yet keep in mind, the sky is still sublime,

through the tearing enlightnings, 
          discouraging rains, 
through the salt-soaked air 
          and bitter, glistening sea,
through those moments that the weathered own your day, 
          and still within misty cries of trying times. 

Rest assured, 
so long as your world turns 
She'll always shine her eyes on you. 
Rise and shine.
