So she actually went ahead and did it.  
What a bitch. 
She's probably smiling to herself; feeling all high and mighty. 
Mighty damn good job. Mighty damn good job indeed. 

She knows I can't work without them.   
It's hard enough to focus on so many damn words thrown at me, 
bouncing around my head, 
rolling around like a dropped basket of marbles. 
I could swear something's going to break. 

It may as well be her face. 

It was too easy for her. 
"Like taking candy from a baby!" 
She won't think it, but she knows it. 
Knows me too damn well. 
Breaks me too damn well. 
Rude, conniving,  audacious wanna-be do-gooder. 
Too much good makes for a pissed off ass. 
It takes one to know one, and two's not even a crowd yet. 

I suppose it doesn't take much to oppress me of this mess. 
I may as well walk it off, 
but then again, 
fresh air isn't the same without a cigarette.
