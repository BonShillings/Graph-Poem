title: Put_with_the_Odd

Put with the odd, no kind or ilk
and nowhere to cling
or a given place, no track
to be on and follow,
a torn-out one, ay am shown the ground
to harrow and rake and flower a grain
for mouths ay had no talk with.

Thrown wide of sky, what goes on with no end,
ay am put to eyes that spy for a kill,
to plants that prick or poison, to animals after a gnaw.

No walking without a prod, no sleeping without a shout,
thems look up close: what are ye? where from?
what use are ye given? what tongue?
and mine own talk closed inside.

Tied to each other, foot to foot,
by loops of hemp, and mine
give out sore at sun-fall.

Ay see brae on the back of a she,
and she in the field as hard.
