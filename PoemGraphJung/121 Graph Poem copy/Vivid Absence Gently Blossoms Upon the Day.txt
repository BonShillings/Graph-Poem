I bid farewell to the lull of thoughts. 
May they carry with them all madness. 
At the very least (Vivid absence),
a goodbye that is meant to be brought. 

They say the phoenix will (gently) rise, 
and surely (blossoms), the morning sun 
manages to come (up) just as it does. 
It’s just ash I've to share with the tides. 

The sound of insanity plays -- (on) 
and on--est, the track expands downstream. 
I've learned to ignore it just like dreams 
during (the day); can't do it for long.
