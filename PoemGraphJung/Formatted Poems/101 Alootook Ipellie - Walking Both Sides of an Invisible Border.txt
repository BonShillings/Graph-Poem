Walking Both Sides of an Invisible Border
 It is never easy Walking with an invisible border Separating my left and right foot I feel like an illegitimate child Forsaken by my parents At least I can claim innocence Since I did not ask to come Into this world  Walking on both sides of this Invisible border Each and everyday And for the rest of my life Is like having been Sentenced to a torture chamber Without having committed a crime  Understanding the history of humanity I am not the least surprised This is happening to me A non-entity During this population explosion In a minuscule world  I did not ask to be born an Inuk  Nor did I ask to be forced  To learn an alien culture  With its alien language  But I lucked out on fate  Which I am unable to undo  I have resorted to fancy dancing In order to survive each day No wonder I have earned The dubious reputation of being The world's premier choreographer  Of distinctive dance steps That allow me to avoid Potential personal paranoia On both sides of this invisible border  Sometimes the border becomes so wide  That I am unable to take another step  My feet being too far apart  When my crotch begins to tear  I am forced to invent  A brand new dance step  The premier choreographer  Saving the day once more  Destiny acted itself out Deciding for me where I would come from And what I would become  So I am left to fend for myself  Walking in two different worlds  Trying my best to make sense  Of two opposing cultures  Which are unable to integrate  Lest they swallow one another whole  Each and everyday Is a fighting day A war of raw nerves And to show for my efforts I have a fair share of wins and losses
 When will all this end  This senseless battle  Between my left and right foot  When will the invisible border  Cease to be.
