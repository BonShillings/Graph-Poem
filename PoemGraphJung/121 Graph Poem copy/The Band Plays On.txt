There’s a tune that keeps on going
it’s got a shuttering swing that tilts me strongly.
It’s continued through the sinking of our ships,
and even well into the booze stained absence that’s taken us. 

My heart keeps the feet tapping, the beat going. 

but I feel beat, with this barrage of backtracked wandering
through so many busted windowsills that bribed common sense
my head has side-stepped more than my hand can count, 
It’s been and can be a bluesy mess 
when I begin mistaking another for our sound	

And there’s so much of it, the sweet melodies 

passing along 
To every cloud sneaking by
to the smoked in stains on the wallpaper ruse
to the brotherman’s smirking style
and to the broken laces of the workman’s boots

Distracting acts of music make me crazy
When I lean my run too ‘em,
I forget the measures, the notes, and the key
But they are you and me, it all sets me free 
so that you and I can dance 

Beat but not broken, are our times. 
These memories, our myriad, they keep the jazz alive.
My oh my, listen to that sweet instrumental
it sings not of you and I, but it is you and I. 

The band plays on.
