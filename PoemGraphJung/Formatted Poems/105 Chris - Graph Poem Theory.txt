In mathematics and computer science, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A "graph" in this context is made up of “vertices” or “nodes” and lines called edges that connect them. 

A graph may be undirected, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another; see graph (mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. 

The graph poem is directed in as much as it is considered in its “chronological” development, but undirected when studied as a connected graph (and therefore) spannable by a tree and/or when its evolution to infinity is looked into by following the locally-finite-graph’s ends (depending on the poem/vertex picked as the spanning tree’s root) revealing the various specific prophecies in the graph poem (see T2).

Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.
The graphs studied in graph theory should not be confused with the graphs of functions or other kinds of graphs.
